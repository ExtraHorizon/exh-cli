# Extrahorizon CLI changelog

### v1.0.0

* Add support for setting execution permission when syncing a task. Options are `permissionRequired`, `allUsers` or `public`.
* Remove implicit settings from task config syncing: some settings, such as `memoryLimit` or `timeLimit`, were given default values when not specified in task config. This can give undesired results, for example custom values in the backend.
* Add support for setting `retryPolicy` in task-config.json.
