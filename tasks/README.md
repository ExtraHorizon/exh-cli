# Tasks

## List tasks

```
exh tasks functions list
```

This command will list all functions currently configured in the task service.

## Create a new function

You can create a new function by uploading your packaged code to the task service.

```
exh tasks functions create <functionName> <options>
```

Take a look at our [Hello-world example](hello-world-task.md) for a nodeJS function.

## Update a function

```
exh tasks functions update <functionName> <options>
```

## Delete function

```
exh tasks functions delete <functionName>
```
